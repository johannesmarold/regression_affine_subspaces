- git
    - Ubuntu/Debian:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install git
      ```
    - Windows: Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Compilation

In the root directory, run the following commands

Linux Makefiles:

```bash
cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDbInfo # BUILD_TYPE can also be `Release` or `Debug`
cmake --build build --parallel
```

Visual Studio:

```bash
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
```

The commands compile all targets by default. If you want to compile a specific target (e.g. `main`) use

```bash
cmake --build build --target main --parallel
```

The compiled executables are located in the `build/bin` subdirectory.
